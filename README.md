JSON Schemata for JSON objects exchanged by LAPPS web services

These schema use the LAPPS Alternate Syntax (LAX), a simplified syntax for JSON schema, 
and must be compiled with the schema compiler at https://github.com/oanc/org.anc.json.schema-compiler

There are currently two schemata:

1. **lif.schema** <br/>
the LAPPS Interchange Format for objects exchanged by LAPPS web services.
2. **metadata.schema** <br/>
the LAPPS Metadata Format for objects returned by calls to `getMetadata()`.
